You'll be receiving written feedback from your instructors after completing the project. Here are the areas in which we evaluate your projects. You may find them helpful as a checklist or guide.

* **Project Workflow**: Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, ERDs, and task-tracking, as specified in the project specs? Did you effectively use version control?

* **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Did you build something that was reasonably complex with the technical knowledge you've gained in the course?

* **Creativity**: Did you add a personal spin or creative element to your project? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

* **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as indentation, spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code and document your project?

* **Problem Solving**: Are you able to defend why you implemented solutions in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?
