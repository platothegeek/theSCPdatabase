                <p><strong>Foreword:</strong> This page is to be devoted to the documentation of low threat anomalous locations which have been discovered by the SCP Foundation over the years. Although all locations listed in this document warrant securing and cover-up measures, none of them are closely enough tied to an underlying anomalous cause or considered a high enough containment or research priority to warrant full Special Containment Procedure documentation. This list may be used as a resource should knowledge of these locations become useful or necessary in the future.<br>

                <strong>Description</strong> An unnamed island (0.44&nbsp;km²) in the Baltic Sea completely devoid of animal life. Land animals introduced to the island gradually lose survival impetus and typically die of dehydration within days. On initial containment, human subjects developed a flat affect within 15 minutes of exposure and became unresponsive to stimuli within two hours. A single subject eventually recovered when removed within 16 hours, although 50% of subjects failed to recover after 4.25 hours exposure (and expired without medical life support). This effect has decreased over time and as of 2018, these thresholds are estimated to have nearly doubled since initial testing.<br>

                <strong>Description</strong> A 2,700-acre campground. Every two weeks over ██ individuals will enter the campground for two days (between the ██th of ████ and the ██th of ████), what these individuals accomplish whilst inside the campground are unknown, as any information pertaining to the location is obscured and/or falsified. Attempts to enter the location during this two day time period have proven difficult, as any person/s entering the location who isn't a part of the original group of subjects who originally entered, will appear to go missing. Photographs sent from Mobile Task Force Zeta-9 ("Mole Rats") have been blurred and obscured immensely, however; the only photograph which has been proven somewhat identifiable contains the remnants of a large owl statue.<br>

After approximately 10 hours of observation, the disk will collapse even further into small concentrated spheres of serotonin-sand matter orbiting a large central mass.<br>

The latter, formerly existing structure was at one time an anomalous structure, however the structure inexplicably lost its anomalous properties in 2010 and was demolished the following year. Satellite surveillance shows minimal activity occurring at either location, but personnel on the ground report seeing neither the structures, nor subjects coming or going from these areas.<br>
