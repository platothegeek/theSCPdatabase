                <p><strong>Foreword:</strong> The SCP Foundation has discovered a substantial number of items which are simply too useless to merit further attention. This document lists those items which have prompted some curiosity. It may be used as a resource should knowledge of these items become useful or necessary in the future. – Dr. █████ █████, Head of Research, Site-██</p>
                <p>This is the third volume of the log. Access to the first and second volume of the log can be found <a href="/minor/items">here</a> and <a href="/minor/items/1">here</a>, respectively.</p>

Doing so permanently inoculates the affected individual to the item's effects but also acts as a short range amnestic, as subjects express surprise when hit by the handle and are unable to identify its anomalous properties, sincerely believing they stepped on the teeth by accident.<br>
                <strong>Date of Recovery:</strong> 5-16-2020<br>
                <strong>Location of Recovery:</strong> Spontaneously manifested in a hallway on Site-██.

                <p><strong>Item Description and Current Status:</strong> So, we've got a fella in a humanoid containment cell that can only be described usin' informal vernacular - you can't talk about 'im using any sort'a upper-crust "clinical" terminology, in other words. The guy himself doesn't seem to know that he's an anomaly - ol' Dr. Umen wants to feed 'im amnestics and let 'im go, considerin' that he's not a threat to normalcy or anythin'.<br>
                <strong>Date of Recovery:</strong> We got 'im back on May 30, 2020.<br>
                <strong>Location of Recovery:</strong> Down in a city near - actually, we can't tell you any a that considerin' that it's top secret or somethin'.</p>

                <p><strong>Item Description:</strong> 997 (and counting) new episodes of Bob Ross: The Joy of Painting. These videos are entirely non anomalous except for the fact that Bob Ross has been deceased for 25 years and these episodes were made after his death. Evidence suggests that these episodes are made by Bob Ross and are broadcasted from Corbenic.<br>
                <strong>Date of Recovery:</strong> Ongoing.<br>
                <strong>Location of Recovery:</strong> Each episode will randomly replace an advertisement slot of sufficient length on the █████████ network. A Foundation bot has been installed to reroute these episodes to the Foundation database and fill the empty time slot with the original programming.<br>

                <strong>Note:</strong> <em>On ██/██/████, an episode was rerouted into the Foundation database and reviewed as per procedure, but instead of starting in usual fashion, Bob Ross said the following: "Hello to my friends at the SCP Foundation, while I am sad that you won't let me continue painting for the world I understand why, and I am happy that my show will continue to bring joy to members of the Foundation and even someone as important as O5-█. With all that out of the way I'd like to thank you all for joining me here this week, if this is your first time watching the Joy of Painting, I'd like to extend a personal invitation for you to pull out your paints and join me, for a relaxing half hour of painting, and I'll show you just how easy it is to make some of the most beautiful art you've ever seen." Episode continued as usual except for the painting, which was later confirmed to be a depiction of SCP-354.</em></p>
                <p><strong>Item Description:</strong> A shipment of twelve █████████ brand acoustic guitars exhibiting the anomalous property that each of the guitar strings will not stop vibrating until manually stopped by use of a person’s finger, and that none of the parts can be damaged. Use of dead or non-biological material will not stop the vibration of the strings, and despite their immunity to damage, the parts still exhibit identical microscopic structures and properties as the materials of the original guitar models. The anomalous properties of the shipment are only exhibited if the original guitars from the shipment contain all of their original parts.<br>
                <strong>Date of Recovery:</strong> 8-12-2016<br>

No physical changes to the branch are noted to happen when the anomalous properties activate. During a test where the branch was held with one hand, 0.26&nbsp;m of the branch snapped off from impact force. The end that snapped off was found to be non-anomalous and incinerated afterwards.<br>
                <strong>Date of Recovery:</strong> 2-11-2016<br>
                <strong>Location of Recovery:</strong> ███████, British Columbia, Canada.<br>

If used to play any mp3 file containing a piece of music, the device will make demeaning remarks about the user's music taste in an unidentified male voice with a "smug" tone upon the conclusion of the piece, or whenever it is paused by the user. If any attempt is made to play a file in a lossless format, the device will fail to play the file, with the same voice proceeding to go on a long, expletive-filled rant scolding the user for being a "pretentious audiophile" in a noticeably angry tone.

                <p><strong>Item Description:</strong> A non-Euclidean "Pringles" brand can of chips that is extended on the inside. As it goes deeper, it gets larger by about 0.001*x<sup>2</sup> cm per every centimeter on the outside (that means that the bottom centimeter is actually 10.29&nbsp;cm). Only chips are affected, with any other object put in being treated as if it's in a regular can. The can, and all the chips inside it, weigh the same as a regular can filled up to a proportional degree.<br>

                <p><strong>Item Description:</strong> A complete set of painting supplies titled, "The Perfect Paint Kit". The paint tubes in the set don't ever seem to empty, despite being poured into a standard paint can built to hold a gallon of paint. The paint brushes are also highly resistant to damage and the bristles are unable to be bent is such a way that would "ruin the paint brush", as claimed to be on the back end of the items original packaging. The paint brushes come to a total of 9, ranging from fine tipped brushes, to more broad lined brushes. The last item in the set, the water pale, always has 3 liters of water in it, and washing paint off the brushes in it doesn't change the color of the water.<br>
