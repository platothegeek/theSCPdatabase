                <h3 style="text-align: center;"> This page is to document anomalous events that have attracted the Foundation's interests, but occurred too briefly for the Foundation to secure or contain them. Instead, the Foundation deploys a cover-up team to conceal the evidence from the public. This is merely a reminder to agents and researchers that not all of them can be contained.<br>
                -Agent Carriontrooper</h3>
                <hr>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A sperm whale estimated to be 2&nbsp;km in length was observed breaching the ocean's surface, causing three nearby boats to capsize upon re-entry.<br>

                <strong>Location:</strong> Puget Sound, Washington, U.S.A<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Foundation removed any details about the anomalous nature of the creature from local news sources. Witnesses on ferries and close enough beaches administered Class A amnestics.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A glowing humanoid figure manifested on a subway platform and was seen by several eyewitnesses and captured on the station's surveillance system. The humanoid approached the edge of the tracks while making vague hand gestures and promptly vanished.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> ██/██/████<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Barcelona, Spain.<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> A team of disguised agents and a portable holographic projection unit were brought to the location. The team explained that the incident was a part of their avant-garde 'urban shock art' exhibition all over Europe. Fake viral media planted to give credence to the team's supposed art group.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Time skips between 2.5 and 26 hours took place in Concord, North Carolina before normalizing to one day after initial skip. Non self-correcting electronic devices such as digital clocks were seemingly unaffected and displayed incorrect times in different areas of the town. Event bears similarity to a relatively unnoticed event in Carson City, Nevada, though no connection could be traced between the two events.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> █/██/████<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Concord, North Carolina, USA<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Local news reported electromagnetic interference caused by a local power plant. Small observation team assigned to area.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> The entire population of Holyhead, Wales was found comatose in a field just outside of town. All individuals were unharmed, but possessed slight burns on their clothing. All individuals woke up 14 hours later with no recollection of the event.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> ██/██/████<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Holyhead, Wales.<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Population dosed with Class-B amnestics. A road accident involving a Samson-Craig Products (an SCP front company) chemical tanker was staged as a cover story. An emergency evacuation camp was arranged and the population were given £150 per head as compensation. Since the event there has been no recurrence or abnormal behavior in the population.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Three similar looking men were witnessed fighting in a gas station parking lot. Eyewitness reports maintain that each man claimed to be ██████ █████████, a well-known local car salesman, and were fighting over which individual was the "true" one. Two of the men were killed when the third procured a crowbar. The third was fatally shot by a local police officer.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> ██/██/████<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Friendship, Oklahoma.<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Witnesses and involved persons were questioned and given Class B amnestics. Close family members of ██████ █████████ were questioned and given Class-A amnestics. A cover story involving the individual's suicide was established. The three bodies were recovered for autopsy and are currently maintained in a Site-19 minimum security storage freezer.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Several students attending ████████ Collegiate began complaining about a loud buzzing noise. A custodian for the school located the source as a single monitor in the computer lab during his duties, and reported the power button was unresponsive. When the lab technicians arrived the next day, they unplugged the monitor after other attempts proved futile. Witnesses of the event report a scream playing through the computer's speakers, and the image of a digitized face screaming appeared for a moment before power was lost.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> ██/██/████<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> ████████ Collegiate in Sandwich, New Hampshire, USA.<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> The monitor was confiscated for inspection. Nothing of interest has been found.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> During an automobile accident, the body of ████ ██, a passenger in one involved vehicle, expanded to fill the entire interior of the vehicle. Because Mr. ██'s expanded body had taken on a consistency similar to stiff foam rubber, the other occupants of the vehicle were protected from the impact, and were the only survivors of the crash.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> ██/██/████<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Seymour, Connecticut.<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Body confiscated, all other occupants and responding personnel administered Class A amnestics. Tissue tests indicate that Mr. Li is still alive, though the tissues of his body have become an undifferentiated mass, and tests of neurological function are inconclusive.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Unidentified and unaccompanied child (estimated age: 7 years old) in a hospital waiting room produces more than 400 kilograms of vomit in 5 minutes, before dying; other patients describe hearing sounds of "glass breaking" during the emesis.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> ██/██/████<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Andranomadio Public Hospital, Antsirabe, Madagascar.<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Majority of vomit had been incinerated before Foundation agents arrived on-site; inspection of hospital incinerator revealed no anomalies. All remaining samples of vomit were confiscated; analysis revealed no anomalies, except that child had been suffering from salmonella poisoning. Witnesses were given amnestics. Child was never identified; body was removed from hospital morgue and is currently maintained in a Site-19 low-value storage freezer.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> An email is sent to, as near as the Foundation can determine, every active email address in existence, including Foundation intranet-only addresses. The contents are identical across all emails and consist of the following message, in Spanish: "Hi, this is Jorge. It has been fun playing with you, but I am going to visit friends next door now. I will be back later to collect my toys. Take care of the place!" Backtracking reveals that all emails originated from the same unassigned IP address.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 12/21/████<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Worldwide<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Foundation agents edited the internet-rumor-debunking site ██████.com to include a statement that the email was a massive hoax. The Foundation has periodically mass-emailed similar messages to more limited audiences as a smokescreen. The originating IP address is being monitored for any further activity.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A suspected associate of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. was observed entering an abandoned factory by Foundation operatives. The sound of bubbling water was heard from within the factory prior to two gunshots. Operatives found the suspect's body in a state of advanced decomposition associated with at least three weeks of exposure. A pistol, which had been fired three times, was found within the subject's jacket. No signs of the suspect's assailant were found.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> ██/15/████<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> ███ ██████, Salvador, State of Bahia, Brazil.<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Information suppressed in local media. Body removed from site by Foundation operatives disguised as Brazilian Federal Police and interred at morgue at Site-60.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Six sperm whale carcasses were found beached along a 2&nbsp;km stretch of coastline at ████████, New Zealand. When autopsy was performed as part of a civilian research program, it was discovered that the chest cavity of all six whales had been hollowed out postmortem without any damage being done to the exterior of the animals. Exploration of the interior carcass revealed the chest cavity of each whale had somehow been stuffed with machinery components trapped in clear plastic.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> ██/18/████<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Akaroa, New Zealand.<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Area sealed. All members of the research team detained and administered Class-A amnestics. False story disseminated claiming that the decomposition of the whales' bodies had led to the build-up of toxic gas inside the carcasses, leading to government intervention on grounds of public health. Masses found inside body cavities removed and shipped to Storage Site-108. Remains incinerated in the field and disposed of through normal channels.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> The ██████ ██████ flight between Heathrow, London and Hartsfield-Jackson, Atlanta suffered a malfunction and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, 800&nbsp;km from the Azores archipelago. Despite this, all passengers and crew walked out the destination gate, remembering only a regular flight.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> ██/11/████<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> North Atlantic Ocean.<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Information suppressed and mass amnestic treatment performed, recovery of aircraft underway.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Every domesticated cat inside the city limits of ██████, Norway traveled 10.9&nbsp;km SE to ██████████████, Sweden over period of 8 hours. Cats congregated in groupings of 13-25 in a field behind [DATA EXPUNGED] for 2 hours, then dispersed.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 25/09/2009<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Norway/Sweden border.<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Cats returned of their own accord to their homes. Any footage of gathering confiscated for study. Witnesses processed, debriefed, and administered Class-B amnestic. Field searched for abnormalities, blood and urine samples taken from cats in affected areas. No anomalies found. Both ██████ and the field will be under surveillance until 30/09/2014.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> During a speech to a public committee, the mayor of Bonifay, FL began continuously chuckling at a pun made by a legislative observer for approximately 4.5 hours straight before collapsing into a nearby chair and passing out. He claims to have no memory of the event, nor did anyone else in the room during the speech. The only available evidence of its occurrence was captured entirely on camera.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> ██/██/19██<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Bonifay, Florida, USA<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Any and all witnesses who videotaped the event, along with anyone who viewed the videotapes themselves were given Class-B amnestics, and all resulting videotapes were wiped clean. The mayor himself is under minor surveillance from select members of the Foundation.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description</strong>: At exactly 2pm, 24 instances of a semi-erotic calendar appeared in numerous Foundation sites. Inside the calendar, images of Dr. Elliot, Dr. Kiryu, Dr. ████, Agent Merlo, Director ██████, Dr. Right, Agent █████, Researcher █████, Agent ████, Dr. Marie, Dr. ████, and Dr. Jack Bright.

                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> The Cincinnati metropolitan area and all objects and lifeforms in it became greyscale for approximately 77 hours, starting at approximately 10:00 AM. All humans in the metropolitan area when the change occurred were not aware of the existence of color while the effect persisted. Those who entered the area of effect after the change occurred were not affected, but affected individuals treated them with fear and suspicion. When the change was reverted through unknown means, all individuals within the affected area lost their memories of the event, although those who had left the area of effect before the restoration of color retained their memories.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 3/21/2014 through 3/23/2014<br>

After the shrine was constructed, the raccoons proceeded to make motions described by onlookers as "bowing" to the shrine, and then quickly scattered. Upon attempted destruction of the shrine by civilian Joseph ███████, a large and aggressive nursery of raccoons emerged, numbering more than 100 by most witness accounts. The nursery proceeded to assault Joseph ███████, resulting in his death.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> █/██/20██<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Brookhaven, Georgia, USA<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> All those who witnessed the event were given Class-A amnestics. Death of Joseph ███████ covered up with a report of a violent mugging. Concert zone acquired by Foundation under the cover of construction. Shrine destroyed by small explosives from a safe distance under the same cover of construction. Observational post disguised as a bird sanctuary constructed. No other anomalous occurrences to date.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> All moths in a 5 kilometer radius of a single porch light made their way towards the light and gathered there for an hour. The moths then dispersed into the surrounding area.<br>

                <strong>Location:</strong> Fall River, Massachusetts, USA.<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> A sample of the snow was obtained; it was found to be mundane. All residents of the town administered Class-A amnestics. As the event occurred quickly, very little video footage was captured. However, all documentation of the event has been destroyed.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> For a period of approximately five hours, ██████ residents of Pompano Beach, Florida and ████ non-residents working in the city, including ██ Foundation employees, experienced a shared hallucination. Interviews with those affected have provided a detailed, highly consistent account of the entire city being transported to the surface of a planet (believed to be Venus), protected by a dome of unknown design. (See Document E-41567-██ for full account.) However, telephone records, security camera feeds and interviews with non-resident non-employees suggest that nothing unusual happened during the time period and that all those affected were present on Earth and went about their business as normal.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> ██/██/2011<br>

                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> At approximately █:26 AM local time, a train bound from █████████ to █████ (hereafter Train-A) collided with an identical train moving along the same line from █████ to █████████ (hereafter Train-B). Of the 56 casualties observed, only 28 civilians were identified. Each civilian was identified twice, with one instance riding Train-A and the other instance riding Train-B. Examination shows that all electronic and time-keeping devices present on Train-B at the time of collision were 9 hours slow. All passengers are confirmed to have been traveling on the route of Train-B 9 hours before the event, though without incident. Temporal interference has been suggested, though the cause is currently unknown and the logical paradox the situation represents has been deemed unsolvable. Whether all civilians involved caught the same train as one another twice consecutively as the result of coincidence or the effect of causal manipulation is unknown. No passengers of either train survived the impact.<br>

                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> An intestinal tumor located in the body of Grover ███████, a 52-year-old man from Des Moines, Iowa, is found to contain an entire secondary brain, including medulla, pituitary gland, and part of a spinal cord. DNA from the brain does not match that of Mr. ███████, and is currently believed to belong to a twelve year-old girl who vanished from Calgary, Alberta, Canada in 1992.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 04/05/2010<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Des Moines, Iowa<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Doctors involved with the surgery amnesticized. Mr. ███████ died following the surgery. Despite several autopsies and examinations, no definitive cause of death has been determined. His cadaver, as well as the brain excised from his stomach, remain in cold storage.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> $237,981 manifested simultaneously, spread across various countries on flat surfaces at approximately $1.3 per square kilometer. This money changed to a different currency depending on the country it manifested within.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 5/9/2014<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Worldwide.<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> None, due to the very obscure nature of the event, and that 87% of all the manifested money was made unusable from external forces.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> The PA system in a Giant Eagle supermarket announced, "Attention Giant Eagle shoppers: the ritual will now commence," whereupon all individuals within the store stopped what they were doing and hummed an intricate series of notes for approximately five minutes. After another tone, the humming ceased and all affected individuals resumed their business as though nothing had occurred.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 10/10/2014<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Columbus, Ohio<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Event would not have come to Foundation attention if not for discovery of security footage during in-store theft investigation. Individuals affected during event have no memory thereof. As such, it has been determined that attempting to identify and interview each person visible on the tape is unfeasible. Videos confiscated, amnestics administered to store staff, and Foundation agents stationed at Giant Eagle supermarkets to monitor for future events or signs of PA system tampering.<br>
                <strong>Update:</strong> As of 27/04/2016, surveillance of Giant Eagle stores has produced no further evidence of anomalous activity. Agents recalled.</p>

                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Various cover up stories to explain missing persons have been enacted. Blinking resulted in minor containment breaches at various sites relating to SCPs pertaining to sight.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Between 16:00:04 UST and 19:53:02 UST, black hole Cygnus X-1 underwent a series of rapid fluctuations in registered x-ray flux density, up to 194.2% of the normal value. When converted into Morse Code, the fluctuations spelled out an expanded, 2018 updated version of the 1988 book <em>A Brief History of Time</em> by the recently deceased physicist Stephen William Hawking. Analysis shows the writing style of the updates to be consistent with that of the original author.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 3/14/18<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Cygnus X-1<br>

                Samurçay following completion of event. DNA analysis of collected blood compared against the Foundation genetic database identified all blood as originating from one Joshua Havaldar, a 34-year-old Indian-American man living in San Francisco. He was unable to provide information on the event, but did report exhibiting symptoms consistent with hypovolemia in the preceding week. Mr. Havaldar was administered Class-A Amnestics following interview. Both the Samur River and Mr. Havaldar are currently under a standard five-year monitoring period.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A small canoe in the Mississippi River was consumed whole by a <em>Carcharocles megalodon</em>, along with its two occupants. <em>Carcharocles megalodon</em> has been extinct for 2.6 million years, and the river in question is much too shallow to contain a creature of that size.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 02/14/2018<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Undisclosed location on the Mississippi River, USA.<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Amnestics were administered to witnesses, and a cover story was circulated claiming the canoe occupants were intoxicated and capsized their vessel accidentally. A task force was sent to locate and capture the anomalous entity, but all attempts to locate the specimen failed.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Unscheduled subway train passes through 36th Street subway station in Brooklyn at approximately 80mph. Eye witnesses describe the train as purple with Arabic lettering on the side. Train wasn't reported appearing anywhere else.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 07/03/2017<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> 36th Street, Brooklyn New York, USA.<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Witnesses administered Class-A amnestics, and footage of the event was confiscated.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> During a Toys R Us staff meeting, an employee later identified as William J. Horack stood, announced, "Well, guess I won't need these anymore," and removed his lips with one hand. Afterward, he began to consume the remaining flesh around his mouth — described by witnesses as having the appearance of "pulled pork" — as the other employees returned to normal operations. Horack continued to autocannibalize over the course of the day, captured only intermittently by security cameras despite not leaving the meeting room. At 19:05, Horack had been reduced to skeletal remains, which then vanished. Eyewitnesses reported confusion that the event did not strike them at the time as being out of the ordinary.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 15/03/2018<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Mayfield Heights, Ohio, USA<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> amnestics distributed to store employees and customers after interviews conducted. Investigation of security cameras revealed no fault. No personal information about William Horack could be attained, and all documentation involved in his three-year employment at Toys R Us appeared to be an intricate forgery. Lips retrieved from initial event location, determined to be faux lips made of wax.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Over the course of five days, the entire student population of ██████ ██ Elementary School in Seven Hills, Ohio developed allergies to all nut-based food products. Faculty and individuals not attending ██████ ██ Elementary who enter the building were unaffected. The symptoms ceased if individuals were removed from the premises for sixty-two hours. Notably, a student at the school, Isaac ██████, is currently comatose following a severe allergic reaction as a result of being force-fed a peanut butter sandwich.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 02/19-02/23/2018<br>

                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> During the decommissioning and deconstruction of Specialized Laboratory 4389-UC!S-11 in Research Sector 8-Alpha of Site-15, ███████ █████ began to experience what was later determined to be a stroke and died in the site medical ward. At the time no actual anomaly was found and operations proceeded as normal. In 1984, Site-15 underwent a routine casual scan which detected retro-casual ectoentropic interference in the events of his death which was confirmed by further scans. To this day the actual alterations made and the entity responsible are unknown.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 06/13/1977<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Site-15, Canada.<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> ███████ █████'s family was told that he died in a civilian construction operation. Deconstruction was completed in 1978 despite set-backs. The event was extensively investigated but no more more information has been gained. It is theorized that the Foundation's methods of detecting these events are flawed and simply reading a false negative but similar malfunctions have not been noted. The records of Site-15 were examined but none of the tests run in the Specialized Laboratory 4389-UC!S-11 had any known retro-casual or ectoentropic properties.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Over a period of 23 minutes, Agent ███████ shrank to 5% her original height, before expiring due to low body temperature. No cause of this anomaly was found.<br>

                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Four new species of landfowl, with entire populations including a domestic breed, spontaneously manifested worldwide. Similarly, all members of the species <em>Struthio Camelus Domesticus</em> vanished, alongside all infrastructure related to their breeding and consumption. The memories of roughly 99.7% of the population were simultaneously altered, causing retroactive acceptance.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence.</strong> 01/18/2008<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Worldwide<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Distance communication between the 0.3% of the population whose memories were not altered are being intercepted and altered by a Foundation AI. Conspiracy groups are tracked down as they arise and administered amnesiacs. The four new species have been classified under a new Genus known as <em>Gallus</em>.<br>

                <strong>Location:</strong> ███████, New Hampshire, USA<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> The freezer's owners were administered Class-A amnestics, and the freezer itself was confiscated under the guise of requiring repairs. Extensive testing failed to produce similar results, and the freezer was placed within Site-19's cafeteria.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> The four heads on Mount Rushmore had changed to several different expressions before returning to normal state. The expressions had included winking, blowing a raspberry, one eyebrow raised, and a mouth into a screaming position.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 28/01/20██<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Mount Rushmore, South Dakota, USA.<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> All witnesses and guests given Class-A amnestics. All security footage of the event was destroyed. Cellphone(s) which has recorded and photographed the event had been destroyed and had their SIM card removed.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> CCTV footage shows a student absentmindedly tossing a water bottle from hand to hand. Upon overshooting and tossing the bottle behind them, as they attempted to grab the bottle, their arm was noted as extending to approx. twice its original length in order to properly catch the bottle. Body language suggests the sudden increase in length was both unintended and extremely painful.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence</strong> 2/4/20<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Sandwich, Illinois, USA.<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Student recovered and arm amputated. Student (and any bystanders during the event) amnesticized, reintegrated into school under the guise of a serious sports wound, and footage erased.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> 37 Foundation custodians with some variation of the name “Howard,“ either as a first name (18), surname (9), or middle name (10), retrocausactively developed a permanent food allergy to eggs and cephalopods. All affected persons in the current baseline reality have now possessed the allergy from an early age, ranging from 0 to 4 years.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 02/06/2020<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Worldwide, although mostly centered in North America and Europe<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> Allergen precautions have been increased in affected Foundation sites. As the affected employees believe they have always been affected, they are not to be informed of this event.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> At 22:20, all buses within an approximate 230 meters of the London bridge had their exteriors changed to a white coloration. Buses then began to change hue, slowly rotating through the observable color spectrum for 25 minutes before fading back to their original coloration.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 07/8/20██<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> London, England.<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Due to the time of occurrence, very few individuals were found to have observed the event. A video taken of the event has been largely regarded as a hoax by the population at large, without need for Foundation intervention. Area is to be monitored for further activity until 8/9/20██.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> For exactly one and a half hours, all staff at Site-97 spontaneously grew a second, far smaller version of their head on their right shoulder that did nothing but whisper cheese or dairy-related puns into their right ear. These heads could not be removed during the allotted time frame, and would only speak over any sort of audio distractions. After the one and a half hours passed, the heads all said in unison "If you wanted more cheese puns, then that's just "swiss"-full thinking! Ha, get it?! It's a cheese pun!" then proceeded to bud off from their original bodies and shrivel into piles of dust.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 03-02-2020<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Site-97, Alaska, USA.<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Entire site cleaned of dust piles created by anomalously formed heads. Cheese and dairy puns have been banned from Site-97 as staff used to be very fond of such jokes, which researchers suspect is what caused such an absurd event. Poster of claymation duo <em>Wallace and Gromit</em> has been removed due to the series' connections with cheese. Site-97 is currently under watch due to this event.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> The pants worn by an unidentified man spontaneously burst into flames. Nearby patrons did not appear startled and instead simply collected available water and hurled it at the man's pants to quench the flames before returning to what they had been doing. Later investigation found that the man in question had been in the middle of a cell phone call with his wife, and had claimed to have been in a restaurant just prior to the event.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 3/6/2020<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> █████ Bar, New Caledonia<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Security camera footage from the bar on the night in question was reviewed, although no footage of the man in question could be found. A cover story involving a stunt for an online video series was circulated.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Two entities resembling humanoid fish were sighted at the base of a lighthouse. Said entities were observed attacking the base of the lighthouse with rudimentary stone weapons, while yelling in an unidentified language. A nearby civilian yelled out to the entities, who panicked and jumped into the ocean.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 3/9/1991<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> █████ Island, Washington, USA.<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions:</strong> Witnesses were administered Class-A amnestics. Damage to the lighthouse was determined to be superficial, and did not require repairing. Surveillance of the waters surrounding the lighthouse have proven inconclusive.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Five emaciated red humanoid figures were spotted at the chain convenience store in ████████. Figures were observed by CCTV surveillance to pass through store aisles, becoming increasingly more distended. Ten minutes after their initial manifestation, entities vanished, and all items within the store were found to have vanished.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 8/14/20██<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Diamond Bar, California, USA.<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Store employees and customers were treated with Class-A amnestics. Store was provided with two members of security who are to watch for additional manifestations until 2028.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description</strong> CCTV footage shows a two second flash of light being emitted from a single streetlight, eliminating all visibility. Following this, the street occupied by the streetlight underwent immediate congestion. Traffic eventually eased to average levels after three hours.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 2/17/20<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Palm Springs, Florida<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions taken:</strong> Area was to be monitored more closely following the event. No further actions are necessary at the moment.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Thirty percent of Bethlehem, Connecticut's population had their appearances altered to match that of former U.S. President James A. Garfield. Victim's memories were also altered to reflect this appearance change. The event was initially discovered when all employees at a local supermarket were discovered to all resemble James A. Garfield.<br>
                <strong>Date Of Occurrence:</strong> 5/██/████<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Bethlehem, Connecticut, USA.<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> At this time, no follow up actions can be concluded by the local police or the Foundation. No further anomalous activity was reported in the area.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A subway-train spontaneously vanished shortly after derailment. Several months later, it was discovered by a group of paleontologists buried under several kilometers of rock. The train was severely damaged and no trace of the driver or 30 passengers were found.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> ██/4/199█<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Toronto, Canada<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions:</strong> The paleontologists were administered Class-A amnestics, and the train was relocated to a Foundation holding facility. Families of victims were provided cover stories of a standard train derailment. Train debris and track were examined for anomalous properties, although none were present.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A subway train departed from ██████████████ Station in Los Angeles, California at 8:00. At 8:11 the train vanished from the tunnel and reappeared at ██████████ Station in London, England at 8:16. Upon reappearance, the train's appearance had morphed to match that of a London Underground subway train. Agents embedded in both Los Angeles and London established communications to quickly take control of the situation by establishing a perimeter around the stations and getting all who had originally boarded the train into Foundation custody.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> ██/██/ 2020<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Los Angeles, California and London, England<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> All who had been aboard the train were interviewed, amnesticized, and taken back to Los Angeles, whereupon they were released. When interviewed, the train operator reported nothing out of the ordinary that could have caused the event. Camera footage from both stations was scrubbed. The train was removed and taken into Foundation custody where it has been monitored and studied for further anomalous properties. As of 4/19/20, none have been shown. Foundation personnel are currently working with UIU agents and British Occult Service officials to keep both stations under a 5 year monitoring period.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> All known humans situated within the general vicinity of a suburb in Seattle, Washington temporarily lost bodily autonomy and invariably maintained their forward velocity for approximately 35 seconds. These bodies were unimpeded by obstructions, with individuals intangibly passing through nearby structures. After the event had subsided, all affected individuals regained autonomy and tangibility, leading to mass cases of suffocation, with exact casualties yet to be accurately determined.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 07/16/2006<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Redmond, Washington, United States<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Widespread amnesticization efforts among affected individuals and families of victims were initiated. Heads of local groups of interest were queried for a potential explanation of the event's origins, to no avail. Notably, during this period, the networks of Microsoft, headquarters located in Redmond, Washington, encountered a brief outage.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A low-frequency pitch was reported emitting from all ground sewers within a city center. Occasional flashes of light were also observed by civilians. This frequency increased in pitch until all glass constructions within close proximity of sewer entrances suddenly shattered, causing an estimated $████ USD in property damage.<br>
                <strong>Date Of Occurrence:</strong> ██/██/2015<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Livingston, California, United States<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> All witnesses were administered Class-B amnestics. Video evidence of the event has been confiscated by the Foundation. CCTV monitors were installed around area to ensure safety of citizens.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> An entire mosasaurus skeleton materialized roughly 8 feet above the floor of █████ ██████████ Middle School, replacing all solid objects in space it occupied, though this was mostly ceiling tiles. The subsequent weight of this added mass and loss of structural integrity quickly led to the collapse of the western roof of the building.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 05/06/2020<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> ████████, Colorado, USA<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Due to quarantine measures already in place in ████████, the school was completely unoccupied and only two civilians witnessed the event, both of whom were administered amnestics. All video footage was recovered and replaced to match a cover story of unchecked mold growth and frequent rain leading to a roof collapse. The skeleton was found to have no signs of decay and was covered in fresh, recently-deceased mosasaurus tissue, and was moved to Site-███ for temporal-paleontological research and subsequent storage. The building is to be monitored until 05/31/2025 for future anomalous occurrences.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> One <em>Blatta orientalis</em> (Oriental Cockroach) grew to a length of 1.2 meters within a civilian residence. The specimen displayed frantic behavior before fleeing the home and impacted by a passing pickup truck. The residents of the house then contacted the local authorities while passersby began taking photographs of the insect.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 05/06/20██<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> ██████ ████, Iowa, USA<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Foundation agents arrived shortly after the call was made and administered appropriate amnestic dosages after confiscating evidence of the event. Despite the efforts of Foundation entomologists, the cockroach perished due to breathing difficulties. Roughly 22 minutes after the cessation of life, the insect returned to average size while unobserved. The body was monitored for potential anomalous properties before disposed of via Site-██'s industrial incinerator.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A charred humanoid entity was seen on CCTV records logged in workplaces and industrial areas. Frequently observed to lay in a fetal position next to an indescribable organic mass for approximately five minutes before rousing and subsequently stepping onto the mass. Audio and video footage afterward damaged/deleted; corporate management denied involvement.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> Unclear.<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Worldwide<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Interrogation attempts unsuccessful. Foundation agents have been embedded within areas of such occurrences posed as civilians. All records containing the event have been confiscated and transferred to Site-██ for further research. Amnestics have been administered accordingly along with regular information suppression tactics.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> On 21/██/20██, A team of 31 researchers, sailing through the Drake passage on an expedition to Antarctica, sighted what seemed to be a surfacing submarine 10km away off the coast of Smith Island. The expedition team, confused as they hadn't been informed of any submarines in the area, attempted to contact via radio but to no avail. A look through binoculars indicated that it was a military submarine, of unknown design, displaying an unknown flag. Not long after, a bright light and thunderous roar were seen and heard as a supposed missile was launched from the distant submarine, and travelled in an easterly direction. The submarine sank back down under the waves and was not seen again. The expedition was called off subsequently.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 21/██/20██<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> 6km NW of Smith Island, Antarctica.<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> The 31 researchers were interrogated individually and administered Class-A amnestics after. A covert foundation-led search team were deployed to the region to search for the rogue submarine, but found nothing after 14 months of searching. The launched missile, an SLBM, reached space and successfully deployed its stages. A single projectile, supposedly a warhead, was detected entering the atmosphere near Bouvet Island, but didn't detonate. Warhead and missile debris were never recovered. The file of this event remains in Site-██ awaiting further investigation.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> The sky visible from inside Site-19 became pale red for 5 seconds, during which the text "SQUONKIPEDIA" in bold white lettering rapidly moved across the sky.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 09/12/2019<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Site-19<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> None, due to all witnesses being Foundation personnel. The cause of this is under investigation.</p>
                <p><em>Note: No known organization or popular media element with the name "Squonkipedia" has been identified.</em></p>
                <p><strong>Event Description</strong> All doorways and windows to Site-25's northeastern guard tower converted into impermeable opaque barriers and communication with the tower was lost. The event immediately ended upon a drilling attempt successfully breaching the floor. For the duration of the event, muffled shouting and construction noises were heard emanating from the inside, although all personnel rescued from the tower report instead hearing an "unearthly warbling" emanating from the outside.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 08/05/2020<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Site-25<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Due to security concerns, the tower may not be closed for more than 24 hours. As subsequent investigations found no anomalous items or entities, no changes will be made to guard schedules. Further anomalous events relating to this location are to be reported immediately.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> At 9:32am, an instrumental piece of music, lasting 3 minutes and 52 seconds, and with composition style resembling that of a national anthem, began playing from the geometric center of the ██████████████ Building of the ██████████████ University, prompting every person within hearing range to interrupt their current activities, stand up with their hand over their heart, and passionately sing along in an unknown language for the duration of the piece, after which they proceeded to resume their activities as if nothing had happened.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 03/11/2019<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Bogotá, Colombia<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Security camera footage retrieved and destroyed, mock footage created to replace it. Witnesses interviewed. All witnesses involved retained clear memories of the event, but showed disinterest or outright aversion in discussing it. None of them seemed willing to mention the event unprompted, and when questioned about it either tried to deflect to other topic, claiming disinterest, or outright refused to discuss it. Amnestics proved ineffective in removing memories of the event. However, due to the unlikeliness of them deciding to discuss it on their own accord, and the destruction of the only footage of the event, amenstic treatment has been deemed unnecessary for the time being. Witnesses are to be placed on a 5-year observation period to detect any potential changes in their behavior and/or the self-containing nature of the event.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> An as-yet unidentified woman, dressed in what witnesses described as "steampunk-style" clothing, was seen walking a live thylacine (<em>Thylacinus cynocephalus</em>) down a busy street. When approached, she was heard to warn the approaching person or persons away by saying, "Careful, she bites," in a Boston accent. After walking the animal for twenty-five minutes, she and the animal entered a taxicab, which promptly drove away. It is worthy of note that the thylacine is known to have been extinct since 1936.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 4/8/2020<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> New York City, NY<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Cover story of a promotional event for a movie shoot circulated. Through questioning of eyewitnesses, the Foundation was able to trace the woman's starting point to another taxicab at the intersection of [REDACTED]. Neither of the cabs has been identified, despite considerable effort. The cabs in question have not been found to belong to any taxi company in the city. Descriptions of the drivers have not been helpful, largely due to the fact that eyewitnesses were captivated by the strangely-dressed woman and her pet.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A public telephone outside of an abandoned grocery store began to ring. A young woman picked up the receiver and heard a heavily-distorted voice say, "Everything you thought you knew is wrong." When she asked what the voice meant, it answered by saying, "The world is not what you think it is." Further questions did not elicit answers, only similar phrases. After nearly three minutes, the woman hung up the phone in frustration.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 6/8/2020<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Miami, FL<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Telephone in question examined and discovered not to be connected to any telephone lines. Investigation revealed that the telephone had not been connected since 2002 and is only still in place because of a dispute about who should be responsible for its removal. Interviews with the woman provided no useful details; woman was amnesticized. Telephone placed under observation for 5 years.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> Every human (<em>Homo sapiens</em>) on Earth simultaneously lost consciousness for approximately one second. Recording devices left running during this period show that all affected people abruptly screamed for the entire duration of the event.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 7/9/2020, 3:23:42 GMT<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Worldwide<br>

                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A Western Rock Lobster (<em>Panulirus cygnus</em>) transmuted into a live human infant whilst being boiled alive.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 09/9/2019<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Geraldton, Western Australia.<br>
                <strong>Follow-up Actions Taken:</strong> All witnesses were administered Class-A amnestics. A window at the Jefferson house had to be repaired. Autopsy revealed the DNA of the carcass was identical to that of an ordinary human. Remains of the infant were cremated and buried.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A team of seven archeologists attempted to open the sarcophagus of Cleopatra. Within the sarcophagus, no body was discovered; however, a single living bee had left the tomb after being opened and proceeded to escape. The location of the specimen is unknown at this time.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurence:</strong> 2/3/2018<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> Alexandria, Egypt<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Archeologists amnesticized. The public perception of Cleopatra's tomb is to be maintained as lost or currently unknown.</p>
                <p><strong>Event Description:</strong> A woman got up from her table at a restaurant and walked directly toward the women's restroom in a straight line, passing through several other tables and diners in the process. Security footage of the event shows the woman appearing to wade as she passes through solid objects, as though walking through deep water.<br>
                <strong>Date of Occurrence:</strong> 29/9/2020<br>
                <strong>Location:</strong> New York City, New York<br>
                <strong>Follow-Up Actions Taken:</strong> Witnesses interviewed and amnesticized. Security footage copied for Foundation records, original files deleted. The woman was placed under observation for future anomalous abilities, to continue until 2025.</p>
