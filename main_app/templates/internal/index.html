                    <h1 id="toc0"><span>Facility Designations</span></h1>
                    <p>The Foundation maintains and operates a large number of facilities worldwide, from small outposts with only a handful of staff to major Sites with thousands of personnel.</p>
                    <h2 id="toc1"><span>Site</span></h2>
                    <p>Foundation facilities designated as Sites are <em>covert</em> facilities, meaning that while existence of the facility is known to the public, such facilities are often disguised under government or corporate fronts. Sites are often built in locations in relatively close proximity to civilian populations, where facilities would require such cover.</p>
                    <h2 id="toc2"><span>Area</span></h2>
                    <p>Foundation facilities designated as Areas are <em>clandestine</em> facilities, meaning that civilians are not aware of their existence at all. Such facilities are often built far away from civilian populations and may contain highly dangerous anomalies; the vast majority of Areas have extreme fail-safe measures such as on-site nuclear warheads.</p>
                    <h1 id="toc3"><span>Facility Sections</span></h1>
                    <h2 id="toc4"><span>Sector</span></h2>
                    <p>Sectors are sections of Sites or Areas that are designated for specific purposes, such as containment, research, or storage. The exact usage of Sectors vary from facility to facility and is dependent on the facility's primary purpose and size.</p>
                    <h2 id="toc5"><span>Unit</span></h2>
                    <p>Units are self-contained sections of Sites or Areas such as those containing Biological or Dimensional anomalies and are designed to self-seal in case of a breach or other catastrophic event. All personnel entering or exiting a Unit must typically undergo a full decontamination procedure.</p>
                    <h1 id="toc6"><span>Prefixes</span></h1>
                    <p>These prefixes are often used to denote specializations of facilities or facility sections and are generally only used in internal communication.</p>
                    <h2 id="toc7"><span>Armed</span></h2>
                    <p>Armed denotes a facility or facility section with abnormally high physical security concerns, either due to containment of violent hostile entities or threat of outside attack. Such facilities typically have a large amount of military-grade weaponry and vehicles as well as a disproportionately large number of permanent security staff; in the case of a full facility, this typically entails a detachment of at least battalion or regiment strength.</p>
                    <h2 id="toc8"><span>Biological (Bio)</span></h2>
                    <p>Biological containment facilities or facility sections deal with infectious or otherwise biohazardous anomalies and are both isolated and self-contained to prevent the possible escape of such anomalies.</p>
                    <h2 id="toc9"><span>Containment</span></h2>
                    <p>Containment facilities or facility sections are primarily equipped and intended for the containment of anomalous objects, entities, or phenomena.</p>
                    <h2 id="toc10"><span>Dimensional (Dim)</span></h2>
                    <p>Dimensional containment facilities or facility sections deal with extradimensional apertures or anomalies exhibiting inconsistent or warped spacetime.</p>
                    <h2 id="toc11"><span>Humanoid</span></h2>
                    <p>Humanoid containment facilities or facility sections primarily deal with sentient, sapient human or near-human entities capable of understanding and complying with instructions. These are essentially analogous to a prison facility for anomalous entities.</p>
                    <h2 id="toc12"><span>Protected</span></h2>
                    <p>Protected facilities and facility sections are "safe zones" kept free of anomalous influence. No anomalies are allowed within these facilities at any time.</p>
                    <h2 id="toc13"><span>Provisional</span></h2>
                    <p>Provisional facilities are those that are established or built around an immobile anomaly. Provisional facilities typically contain only a single anomaly.</p>
                    <h2 id="toc14"><span>Reliquary</span></h2>
                    <p>Reliquary facilities or facility sections are designed for handling artifacts and objects of religious or historical significance.</p>
                    <h2 id="toc15"><span>Research</span></h2>
                    <p>Research facilities or facility sections are designed for either the handling and study of anomalies or anomalous materials or research and development of new containment schemes and methods.</p>
                    <h2 id="toc16"><span>Storage</span></h2>
                    <p>Storage facilities or facility sections are intended for long-term storage of non-anomalous or inert anomalous objects with no risk of autonomous interaction.</p>
                    <h1 id="toc17"><span>Miscellaneous</span></h1>
                    <p>These are Foundation facilities or locations that do not fall under the standard organizational structure.</p>
                    <h2 id="toc18"><span>Observation Posts</span></h2>
                    <p>Observation Posts are tiny facilities established in a multitude of locations worldwide. Often limited to small standalone buildings or single units within larger buildings, Observation Posts are typically used to monitor regional communications for flagged content, as well as monitor nearby Foundation facilities. Many Observation Posts are also used as secure communications hubs or safe-houses by undercover Foundation agents.</p>
                    <h1 id="toc19"><span>Facilities List (Abridged)</span></h1>
                    <p>The following is a partial list of notable Foundation facilities. Please note that this list is incomplete; many Foundation facilities are not listed here due to operational security requirements or because their purpose and/or location are classified. Many facility designations have also been recycled over time as the original facilities are decommissioned or otherwise no longer in use.</p>
                    <h2 id="toc20"><span>Sites</span></h2>

                    <p>Site-54 is a containment facility located in, around, and beneath the city of Leipzig, Germany. Specialising in the containment of those anomalies deemed 'partially uncontainable', the Site's staff are heavily armed, highly trained, and permanently on edge. Featuring an extensive rapid-response vehicle hangar (with transport both normal and anomalous) and wide array of holding cells, Site-54 is generally considered to be the Foundation site both best-prepared for the worst to happen, and the location at which said worst is most likely to occur. Objects currently under the facility's jurisdiction include: <a href="/scp-265">SCP-265</a>, <a href="/scp-1911">SCP-1911</a>, <a href="/scp-2668">SCP-2668</a>, <a href="/scp-2790">SCP-2790</a>, <a href="/scp-2856">SCP-2856</a>, <a href="/scp-3663">SCP-3663</a>, and <a href="/scp-4856">SCP-4856</a>.</p>

                    <p>Established in the Black Rock Desert of Nevada, May 1972, Site-56 was intended to serve as the base of operations for the enactment of the <a href="/scp-378">Kraken Protocol</a> within the American Southwest. Over time, Site-56 took on increasing responsibilities, eventually transitioning into a full-fledged containment and administration site; however, recent Overwatch audits suggest its expansion has surpassed its budgetary and logistical limitations, and personnel frequently cite its "labyrinthine" structure as a detriment to day-to-day operations. Objects contained on-site include <a href="/scp-4495">SCP-4495</a> and <a href="/scp-5444">SCP-5444</a>, with select offsite anomalies such as <a href="/scp-5994">SCP-5994</a> falling under its jurisdiction as well.</p>

                    <p>Site-87 is a research site, established in September 1976 to oversee containment of a minor anomaly in the town of Sloth's Pit, Wisconsin, USA (pop. 17,291 as of 2020). In that same month, researchers discovered that Sloth's Pit was a highly active Nexus, an inhabited zone that has a high concentration of anomalous phenomena. Site-87's civilian front is S &amp; C Plastics, and it possesses its own Task Force— Sigma-10, "The Sloth's Arm", dedicated to containment of anomalies within city limits. Citizens of Sloth's Pit are considered E-Class Personnel, and have knowledge of the Foundation insofar as 'a research organization is monitoring the town'. The primary goal of Site-87 is to research and catalog anomalies in Sloth's Pit, such as <a href="/scp-4040">SCP-4040</a>; however, it is also the headquarters of the Department of Multi-Universal Affairs, Nexological Studies, and serves as regional command for the Midwestern United States.

Site-91 was originally adapted from its previous use to contain SCP-4612 (which was found in the substructure below the manor), but was expanded to a full containment facility, research lab and library. The site is located upon the grounds of a manor commonly known as Eckhart House; located in Yorkshire, England. The site's research focus is the containment and analysis of xenobiological specimens, with a secondary focus of the development of thaumaturgical countermeasures and containment of thaumaturgical artifacts. Serves as the primary station for MTF-Beta-777 (“Hecate’s Spear”) due to their familiarity and expertise in thaumaturgical analysis.

                    <p>Male. European descent. American origin. Verified post-human lifespan; 148+ years of age. Varying appearance.</p>
                    <p>A holdover of the occult organizations preceding the Foundation, so he likely benefits from more preservation techniques than merely <a href="/scp-006">SCP-006</a>, and he likely possess a large degree of anomalous protection.

                    <p>One possible identity for the original Administrator.</p>
                    <p>Evidence strongly suggests that he was born Aaron Siegel in the late 1800s (possibly 1866). Certainly, one Aaron Siegel was a physicist studying at Cornell University in 1891, who disappears from the historical record after this year. This timeline doesn't match what we know of O5-1's activity, but given his position and the reality-restructuring events that have occurred, it's entirely possible.</p>
                    <p>Rumor has it that he's <a href="/annon">Gears'</a> <a href="/loosen-up-a-bit">father</a>. If true, this would make him the Black Queen's grandfather — <span style="color:black; background-color: black">my grandfather</span>.</p>

                    <p>Claims to be "Adam's third wife." Claims to be the mother of modern humanity. Possible mother of <a href="/scp-076">SCP-076</a>-2 and <a href="/scp-073">SCP-073</a>. Claims that she (and Adam) were not the first humans, but merely the leaders of the first agricultural humans (possibly; reported details vary), who brought humanity from the Garden.</p>
                    <p>Claims that Adam was (or became) a reality bender, but that she herself is not.

                    <p>O5-2 is usually reported to possess certain… unique anomalous traits. As you will see from the following reports, there is an odd sort of consistency in between the vast contradiction. Consistency is unusual for O5 member reports. Possible sign of a disinformation campaign… or a very strange truth. Perhaps I know which, but I could not tell you.</p>

                    <p><strong>O5-2: "The Gardener".</strong></p>
                    <p>Female. European descent. American origin. Appears to be 80+ years old. Actual age unknown. No unusual appearance.</p>
                    <p>O5-2 is apparently a second version of Foundation Director Dr. Sophia Light, a holdover from an erased timeline (she seems to have had a hand in this erasure). She is very different from the current Sophia Light, Director of Site-41, who is unaware of her alternate's status or identity. Considered extremely dangerous, even compared to the other O5s. Known for making tough, pragmatic decisions.</p>
                    <p>Promotes research of SCP objects and the anomalous in general. Has consistently stuck to this despite regularly shifting Foundation attitudes towards containment versus research. Pushed for a reasonable degree of anomalous object cross-testing. Implemented higher standards of non-SCP anomalous item categorization by the Foundation. Strong believer in pragmatic research (or theoretical research that leads to pragmatic work), believing this to be most beneficial to the Foundation in the long run. Wishes to deconstruct the anomalous so that the Foundation understands it.</p>
                    <p>Rarely seen in public. Said to have a grandmotherly attitude.</p>

                    <p>O5-2 is apparently a version of Foundation Doctor Sophia Light, either a holdover from an erased timeline, or, perhaps, the original version of Sophia Light (making the publicly known version a duplicate, or the same person). She appears to be similar to the publicly known Sophia Light in personality and appearance (with the exception of ethnicity), but otherwise differs due to extensively differing life experience. The publicly known Sophia Light is unaware of her alternate's status or identity.</p>
                    <p>O5-2 possesses various reality-bending capabilities, the extent of which is currently unknown. May have some claim to divine status.</p>

                    <p>O5-2 is apparently a version of Foundation Doctor Sophia Light, either a holdover from an erased timeline, or an immigrant from an alternate timeline. He resembles the current Sophia Light in every way except his gender, age, and first name: "Stefan".</p>
                    <p>He travels everywhere with a similarly unusual secretary/bodyguard, who he seems to be in a romantic relationship with. She is named Tracy Lament, and appears to be a version of Foundation Agent Troy Lament, and coming from the same origin as O5-2.</p>
                    <p>Neither Dr. Light nor Agent Lament are aware of their doubles' identity or status.</p>
                    <p>O5-2 has pushed repeatedly for a particular sweeping change to Foundation policy: that anomalous objects which become fully understood by the Foundation be universally declassified and introduced to the non-anomalous scientific community (even those alien to current standards of normalcy and established scientific principles). So far, he has met with little success in this endeavor, due to strong opposition from other members of the O5 Council.</p>

                    <p>Proposed an anomaly progression model based on the second law of thermodynamics, which was rejected by the other members of the O5 Council. Since their first known meeting, has usually voted 'Abstain'.</p>

                    <p>Joined the O5 Council in in the 1930's, shortly after World War 1. Known for caring about the social ramifications of science; strongly opposed social Darwinism.</p>
                    <p>Generally a voice of caution; the "conscience" of the O5 Council, even if often overridden by other members, and even if often endorsing Foundation projects he does not fully agree with.</p>

                    <p>O5-3 is particularly shrouded in myth. He is presented as a literal supernatural figure in some reports, and as a perfectly ordinary man in others. Ordinarily, this could be chalked up to religiously related manipulation, but as an O5 member, some claim to divine status cannot be discounted.</p>

                    <p>He also works with the Administrator in a more traditional ambassador role, privately meeting with heads of state and high-tier organizations such as the Global Occult Coalition/United Nations to negotiate such matters as Foundation access to countries. Has a sizable staff of diplomats working under him.</p>
                    <p>Pertinently: How does he keep finding me? And why doesn't he share that with the rest of the Foundation? Possibly bound to an esoteric/anomalous rule-set. Requires investigation.</p>
                    <p>Excerpt from intercepted communication:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>A lot of fieldwork and being in the wrong place at the right time. Got to be a little bit of a diplomat, and ended up getting sent out to talk to various GOIs over the years. Got pretty good at it. Too good, really.<br>
                    Another of those who ended up being promoted because he's so damned good at his job, but not entirely trusted, because he walks places people shouldn't go, and keeps secrets.<br>

                    <p>A relaxed, gentle man, despite his stern reputation. Not shy about appearing in public, or publicizing his projects. Kept up impressive security measures to counter this. Known for traveling with a large, friendly mastiff named (almost comically) "Rover".</p>
                    <p>Did not reflect the mindset of his compatriots regarding use of anomalous objects. Strongly opposed the weaponization of SCP objects. One of several O5 Council members who strongly opposed cross-testing and in many cases general research on the anomalous as well.</p>
                    <p>Came into his own after the series of incidents that included SCP-076 causing the destruction of Area-25 and MTF Omega-7, Dr. Kondraki mostly destroying Site-19 by deliberation of breaching 682 in reaction to manipulation by O5 members, a researcher wiping himself and several sites from existence, and a string of serious accidents resulting from cross-testing SCP objects.</p>
                    <p>Following these incidents, O5-4 and his newfound allies within O5 Command found their position suddenly quite popular indeed. A great number of projects were outright ended, and a new policy came into effect: little research on anomalous objects should be done except that which is necessary for containment. Research was considered too dangerous. SCP objects would be examined mostly in isolation from each other. Cross-testing mostly ceased. This would be unofficial Foundation policy for the better part of the following decade.</p>
                    <p>O5-4's sway began to fail in more recent times, and then he was abruptly assassinated by operatives of the Chaos Insurgency. (In practice, this could mean almost anything, given the nature of the Insurgency.)</p>

                    <p>O5-4 played a large role in Foundation manipulation of world governments and economic systems. Additionally, he had extensive ties to organized crime and domestic terrorism, ties which existed before his elevation to the O5 Council. He simply never let them go, and the obvious utility of crime connections during the Foundation's early years allowed him to justify these questionable continuing relationships. Most people who the Foundation 'disappeared' or assassinated during their formative years were targeted under the auspices of O5-4.</p>
                    <p>Helped design the first iteration of the Chaos Insurgency (as a Foundation black ops project) before defecting with the fully realized Chaos Insurgency during the Foundation Civil War. Although not a mastermind of the "true" Insurgency (better thought of as an alliance between then-O5-7 and then-O5-11), is likely significantly responsible for its success post-schism, for when he left, he took his connections with him.</p>
                    <p>When O5-4 defected, the Foundation wiped out all his operations and reassigned or terminated his remaining staff. Though this was likely a good choice for them long-term, this partially contributed to certain destabilizations in world economies of the time.</p>

                    <p>Male. European descent. American origin. Mid-40s. Long hair kept in a ponytail. Nearly always dresses in white suits, with a white Stetson "Boss of the Plains" cowboy hat, and carries a white cane with the handle carved in the shape of a wolf's head. Unknown significance, if any.</p>
                    <p>Former top Foundation field agent; other details of prior identity unknown (probable wipe). Professional yet genial. Reputation for high competency. Plays something of a "jack of all trades" role within the Foundation, but focuses particularly on issues of Foundation security.</p>
                    <p>One of the O5s seen more often in public. Travels with two male bodyguards referred to as "Thompson" and "Black".</p>

                    <p>One of the founding members of the O5 Council, O5-6 was already old when he joined. He is now said to have aged beyond even the abilities of <a href="/scp-006">SCP-006</a> to rejuvenate him. He still survives, for now, but he rarely if ever takes any action on the O5 Council. His secretary runs things for him, up to and including voting according to his wishes on O5 Council matters.</p>

                    <p>Male. European descent. American origin. Early 40s. Typically dresses in tasteful suits.</p>
                    <p>Rarely seen in public, but a very active member of O5 Command internally. What few are aware of is that he is a puppet inserted into the O5 Council by the Global Occult Coalition as a possible future attempt at hostile takeover, or perhaps a failsafe.</p>
                    <p>It seems possible that some or all of the other O5 Council members are aware of his status as a turncoat, and tolerate the situation for their own reasons. Perhaps they view him as a potential asset, or at least view the knowledge of his situation as a potential asset.</p>

                    <p>One of the longer-term members of the O5 Council. Described as not especially morally scrupulous with her power, although with her heart in the right place, or at least near the right place. A master tactician, charismatic, and fairly dangerous.</p>
                    <p>Does not often appear in public, and often works through intermediaries at first; a believer in private meetings over public speeches. Generally friendly in demeanor in personal interactions, right up until she's not.</p>
                    <p>Possibly an ex-university professor (surprisingly). Has implemented a number of training program in various areas across the Foundation.</p>
                    <p>Also notable for "adopting" Dr. Alto Clef and approving a number of his experimental (and sometimes unnecessarily dangerous) projects.</p>

                    <p>Reputation for being somewhat dangerous to be around. Has survived a curious number of assassination attempts unscathed (with the assassins dead in the wake of the attempts); unusual that an O5 would both leave themselves vulnerable to so many attempts and also survive so many in such a manner. Possible anomalous protection.</p>
                    <p>Takes a special interest in SCP objects stolen or acquired by the Chaos Insurgency. Numerous reports indicate that O5-7 is, in fact, the current head of the Chaos Insurgency, despite this directly contradicting many other reports about the Chaos Insurgency's status as a splinter organization. Reports differ on whether the rest of the O5 Council is unaware of this, or knows and partially or fully endorses it.</p>

                    <p><strong>O5-7: "The Professor", or "The Heretic".</strong> [DEFECTED]</p>
                    <p>Male. European descent. American origin. Appearance unknown.</p>
                    <p>A professor at a major university and a trained psychologist; held the former position even while a member of the O5 Council, before disappearing from both upon defection. Developed a large number of training programs across the Foundation, many of which are still in use today in some form.</p>
                    <p>One of the primary instigators of the Foundation Civil War. Defected from the Foundation along with the then-current O5-4, O5-11, and O5-12, as well as a number of Foundation generals and another O5 who was killed during the schism.</p>
                    <p>A major thought leader in the Insurgency; possibly co-created the first iteration of the Insurgency, which seems to have been originally an organization used for covert Foundation operations under another (relatively nonsensical) name, and likely still exists in this form as well as the latter day article. Embraced the name "Chaos Insurgency" as legitimate during the schism; is likely the reason the Chaos Insurgency is called the Chaos Insurgency. <a href="/welcome-to-the-future">Apparently still active in the Insurgency to this day.</a></p>
                    <p>Advocated for research into numerous venues the rest of the O5 Council deemed too dangerous to touch, including chaos magics and a reality warping god-engine (both in current use by the Chaos Insurgency today). Advocated for large-scale weaponization and active use of SCP objects. Spent an inordinate amount of time researching the brain structure of anomalous humanoids.</p>
                    <p>Foresaw the increase in anomalies that was only beginning to be experienced by the Foundation (and general anomalous community) of the time; expressed that to survive, the Foundation would need move from merely preserving normalcy to actively determining normalcy, and determining the future for the human race at large.</p>
                    <p>Accused of having a 'god complex'; took these accusations as a compliment. Took the position that God was missing or dead, and therefore the Foundation needed to take his place. A line often quoted by his supporters: "Heaven is empty, and all the angels are here."</p>

                    <p><strong>O5-7: "Teeth".</strong></p>
                    <p>Agendered. East Asian descent. Chinese origin. Verified post-human lifespan. Appears to be mid-40s; almost certainly older. Androgynous appearance (in normal form). Always wears two ivory hair-sticks. Reports claim these were fashioned from human teeth/bone; obvious occult significance.</p>
                    <p>Unusually for an O5 Council member, it seems unclear whether O5-7 was originally fully human. They possess the ability to shift between a human form, and a variety of difficult-to-describe eldritch beings. They are supposedly involved in the containment of (and maybe collaboration with) certain "extraplanar" entities beyond Lovecraft's weirdest dreams.</p>
                    <p>This is an unusual set of reports. This O5-7 is supposedly both very human (hard to get more specifically human than all those culturally specific details), and yet supernatural to an extreme degree. The consistency in the reports has disturbing implications about the Foundation's hidden activities, even if this O5-7 is a cover for someone or something else.</p>

Signatory of the <a href="/wrong-proposal">Forbidden City Convention</a>.</p>
                    <p>Opposed Foundation attempts to enforce control over the Middle East during the early 20th century, citing that "it is already taken care of". Possible foreknowledge of <a href="/oria-hub">ORIA</a> or an equivalent organisation?</p>

Joined the O5 Council in 1967 as a ploy to gain access to <a href="/scp-006">SCP-006</a>, in an attempt to achieve immortality. One of the only O5s to be directly recruited from the civil sector.</p>
                    <p>Attempt was successful until the sudden appearance of several more individuals claiming to be Harold Holt, at which point he was stripped of all authority and given an SCP designation. Was within containment for 46 years, until all Harold Holts staged a containment breach.</p>
                    <p>Evidence suggests there may be as many seventy seven different versions of Harold Holt, each with their own form of immortality. Reason for this unknown. Possibly a quantum collation of different outcomes, a deliberate attempt at creating many versions to guarantee at least one would survive, or an example of a multiverse collapse.</p>

                    <p>Male. European descent. American origin. Mid-30s. No unusual appearance.</p>
                    <p>A former Foundation Site Director; a recent elevation to the O5 Council (between 6 and 9 years as of 2014).</p>
                    <p>One of his first actions as an O5 Council member was to approve of Dr. Kondraki's plan to neutralize the former SCP-083. This plan resulted in the breaching of multiple SCP objects, including Kondraki deliberately breaching <a href="/scp-682">SCP-682</a>, and in the near destruction of Site-19. This incident appears to have lead to the O5-ordered assassination of Kondraki by Dr. Gears.</p>
                    <p>Though he was not removed from the O5 Council over this, O5-8 never recovered. Still shaken from the fallout of the incident, he continues to rely on support staff to accomplish all of his duties — including the hiring and replacing of support staff.</p>
                    <p>Thus far, O5-8 has avoided further serious incidents, but rumor has it that the situation with his current crop of staff is unstable and likely to cause further "mistakes".</p>

                    <p>O5-8 is known for being brutal and harsh, though never arbitrarily; known for making hard decisions. Known to have played a deciding vote in the decision to nuke several significant Foundation Sites during a particularly deadly breach.</p>
                    <p>Her physical appearance is deliberate. Overseers certainly can alter their appearance if they wish. This seems to be due to an emotional state plagued by guilt. Considered vulnerable to assassination attempts due to rumors that she would welcome them.</p>

                    <p>O5-8 is one of several O5 members to focus on Foundation security. Notable in particular for expanding Mobile Task Force funding and recruitment; responsible for a general proliferation and expansion of MTFs after the destruction of Omega-7 initially resulted in cutbacks.</p>
                    <p>Said to have a relatively low-key personality, but prone to becoming slowly more aggressive as situations escalate; many underlings report that he is very pleasant to work with at first, but invariably sours relationships as they evolve over the years.</p>
                    <p>There are also reports that rumor that "Dogwood" is in fact associated with another O5 report, "The Newbie"/"The Lesser", and that in fact "Dogwood" is one of the actual O5-8's competing chiefs of staff, whose star is presently falling due to internal drama. Even more reports claim that "Dogwood" and O5-6 "Cowboy" are the same person, and that the negative attributes assigned to "Dogwood" are the result of disgruntled ex-staff members who couldn't live up to O5-6's standards. It is unclear if this is yet more disinformation.</p>

                    <p><strong>O5-9: "The Outsider." / "The Ordinary."</strong></p>
                    <p>Female. European/Pacific Islander descent. New Zealand origin. Appearance consistent with recorded age of 53. Carries a walking stick with jade inlays; item's purpose unclear, whether occult or practical.</p>
                    <p>O5-9 is one of the most unusual O5s, for an oddly mundane reason: she appears to have been inducted directly into the O5 Council from the public sector.</p>
                    <p>The reason for her recruitment is unknown, given her complete lack of previous Foundation experience. Formerly Donna Whetu Taylor, a noted geologist, she was inducted shortly after retracting a major publication and resigning in scandal. Stated reason for the retraction was scientific misconduct including fabrication of data, but the scandal was more likely a Foundation cover-up: the few available fragments of the retracted publication suggest that Taylor had discovered several geological and geophysical anomalies, and was developing a general theory of their function.</p>
                    <p>Strong advocate for research of anomalous phenomena, including those with SCP designations; possible ally of O5-2 ("The Gardener"). Apparently partially responsible for allowing the recent dramatic expansion of the Foundation's classified technical journals (a project apparently spearheaded by Regional Director Katherine McTiriss, if rumor is correct). Goals appear to include the development of a general explanatory theory for anomalous phenomena.</p>
                    <p>O5-9's unusual circumstances have led to a large number of contradictory reports. As far as I can tell, she replaced or superceded a prior O5-9 ("Misfortune").</p>
                    <p>It's said her appointment barely passed, with a Council vote of 7 to 6. At least three votes swung to her side at the last moment. Evidence of tension within Overwatch?</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p><strong>O5-9: "Misfortune".</strong></p>
                    <p>Varying age, appearance, etc. Original unknown. Carries a bone-handled knife; obvious occult significance.</p>
                    <p>O5-9's personality is based in <a href="/scp-963">SCP-963</a>-2. Original version attempted to replicate SCP-963 — successfully. However, SCP-963-2 only holds the memories, experiences, and personality of O5-9 up until his first death.</p>
                    <p>When O5-9 is killed — and he has been killed several times — he is "reset". After each death, he has to be informed of events that took place after the time of his first death.</p>
                    <p>Reputation for being extremely unlucky. Restricted to underwater Foundation facilities. May or may not still hold an O5 Council position, but certainly plays a role regardless.</p>
                    <p>Possibly replaced by another O5-9, "The Outsider". Reports that claim his removal state that it was not voluntary, and was caused by one or more of the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                    <li>a series of repeated 'resets' rendering him useless</li>
                    <li>corruption or damage to SCP-963-2 causing personality damage</li>
                    <li>Resistance to any form of change after being reset repeatedly</li>
                    <li>Inability to change with the times due to being reset repeatedly</li>
                    <li>Refusal to make use of his vote during an incident in which it was vital post-reset</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Which is most likely is unclear.</p>

                    <p>O5-9 is two people sharing the same position. They appear to be lovers. They change positions regularly, with one playing the role of bodyguard/"assistant" to the other.</p>
                    <p>O5-9 plays a "support" role within the Foundation. Primarily, O5-9 handles feeding the Foundation. They generally have a hand in procuring mass amounts of food via ordinary methods, and their staff cover it up. But they don't limit themselves to non-anomalous means. Reports also abound of vast anomalous fields growing food to feed Foundation personnel, and entire rivers created in certain remote areas of countries to produce water.</p>

                    <p>O5-11 is the Foundation's chief disinformation officer. She organizes cover ups, invents cover stories, and creates rumors to be spread both within the Foundation and without. This includes many erroneous reports about O5 Command (that is, assuming this report itself is not erroneous, which it may be). Not even her staff know what's true and what isn't; and in many cases, neither does she.</p>

                    <p>Very little information exists on O5-12's role within the Foundation, except that he was an exceptional researcher. Known primarily for fathering a stillborn child in the mid or late 1800s, and transforming her into <a href="/scp-321">SCP-321</a> in an ill-fated attempt to save her.

                    <p>O5-12 was an emergency appointment following a previous assassination (or assassination attempt) during an O5 Council issue that required either an O5-12 or an O5-1, and O5-1 was unavailable.</p>
                    <p>After this, he couldn't simply be demoted; therefore, he was assigned to side projects. He purchases land to build Foundation facilities on. He works with people who design Foundation facilities to make sure their needs are met; he works with local governments (often to request that military installations be built over actual Foundation sites as a cover); and he hires new Foundation personnel to implement such projects.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, O5-12 acts as an unofficial head of human services, requiring that Foundation personnel receive regular physical and mental checkups. Despite apparently caring a great deal about the average Foundation member, O5-12 is usually described as an obsessive, distrustful shut-in. His staff is very small, and they do very little.</p>

                    <p>One of O5-12's significant roles was overseeing the rotation of SCPs between Foundation facilities. This rotation was publicly aimed at getting new perspectives on SCP objects for research and effective containment purposes. Less public, but no less important, was the secondary purpose of preventing any group of researchers from working with humanoid SCPs for too long.</p>
                    <p>Initially resisted defecting from the Foundation, but was strong-armed into joining the Insurgency by his wife, O5-11. His position of control over SCP rotation and transportation allowed the Insurgency to make off with a very high number of SCPs (particularly humanoid SCPs) during the schism. Additionally, his popularity with Foundation generals who desired weaponization of SCP objects gave the Insurgency a significant power boost during the Foundation Civil War.</p>

                    <p>A number of reports have indicated that the Foundation did not start with 13 O5 Council members. Most reports indicate that the original O5 Council numbered 12 (though some go higher, including mention of O5 council members being granted numbers and assigned to specific <a href="/scp-001">SCP-001</a> objects). Others indicate it <em>still</em> numbers only 12, with number 13 a work of disinformation.</p>
                    <p>Other reports indicate an O5-13 was added after the fact due to the number 13 gaining modern occult significance and therefore power. And in practical terms, a tiebreaker vote was required once too often.</p>
                    <p>Several of these options may be true. These reports reflect this lack of clarity.</p>

                    <p>O5-13 does not exist. Everyone outside the O5 Council is told he exists, and memos are created under O5-13's name, but O5-13 exists only as a tiebreaker vote.</p>
                    <p>O5-13's vote is rotated between each O5 Council member, starting at 1 and passed up a number each time a tiebreaker vote is required and used.</p>
                    <p>Holding O5-13's vote is required to access a few selected databases. This knowledge may be attached to O5-13's vote (and wiped from the holder's memory when the vote is passed on), or it may simply comprise access to 13's unique databases.</p>

                    <p>O5-13 is an artificial intelligence construct. This AI construct (using a variety of anomalous technological and non-technological methods) is supposedly able to take all factors relevant to the Foundation's goals and make a recommendation on any major course of action.</p>
                    <p>Due to certain consequences (whether occult, resourced-based, or simply bureaucratic) of making use of this AI construct, it is only employed when the O5 Council must break a tie on a non-trivial matter.</p>
                    <p>Further details have been remarkably hard to attain even by esoteric methods. Whether or not this version of O5-13 exists, there are secrets behind this <em>thing</em> that the Foundation wishes especially to be kept.</p>

                    <p>One of the more outlandish reports on a possible O5-13; claims that Death itself was bound by the O5 Council in the early 19th century. Per these reports, the slot of O5-13 was created for Death in the first place. Euphemistically referred to as "The Other Overseer."</p>
                    <p>Death is both a member and a prisoner of the O5 Council; it can cast a vote as normal. However, it is imprisoned by the rest of the Council, and by a majority vote of the O5 Council, the Council can control it. Death apparently otherwise carries out its functions as normal.</p>
                    <p><a href="/scp-006">SCP-006</a> does not exist; the longevity of O5s actually stems from O5-13. By majority vote, they can order O5-13 to stay its hand from any Council member — or indeed anyone in the world, though using this power for non-Council members seems to temporarily weaken Death's chains, and is therefore rarely used.</p>
                    <p>When used, it is typically on a mass scale — <a href="/scp-2000">SCP-2000</a> and similar anomalous items also do not exist, and are used as cover for every time that Council has voted to utilized O5-13's power to return most of the world's population back to life.</p>

                    <p>O5-13's special connection to the anomalous gives him a perspective no other council member could begin to fathom. While Normalcy Confirmation meetings require eleven members for quorum, no meeting is allowed to proceed without O5-13's attendance.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, he is the only member of the original O5 council to survive the Caesar incident. <a href="/captain-kirby-s-proposal">Investigation into the nature of the incident and O5-13 is still ongoing.</a></p>

                    <p><strong>A note on the Administrator.</strong></p>
                    <p>The Administrator's role within the SCP Foundation is often nebulous. Consistently said to associate with numerous major heads of government, and to represent Foundation interests to them. Also said to be associated with <a href="/scp-262">SCP-262</a>. These things, at least, seem to be true, at least assuming the Administrator exists.</p>
                    <p>If reports are to be believed, each Administrator has had some consistent anomalous traits which may be a factor of the position, including partial protection from reality shifts and extremely slow aging.</p>
                    <p>The Administrator's position in relation to O5 Command is unclear. The Administrator may hold a position similar to an O5 Council member, and may be less powerful or more powerful depending on a particular situation — or a particular time. Because of all this, the Administrator often comes off seeming like a wild card, if a rather calm wild card.</p>
                    <p>There appear to have been multiple Administrators over the Foundation's lifespan, but no reports have as of yet indicated more than one at a time.</p>

                    <p><strong><a href="/the-administrator-s-biography">Administrator: "The Official"</a></strong></p>
                    <p>Male. European descent. American origin. Verified post-human lifespan; reported as appearing between mid-30s and mid-50s. No unusual appearance.</p>
                    <p>Note: This version of the Administrator has been repeatedly confirmed as a false front, used as a cover for one or more of the Foundation's actual Administrators.</p>
                    <p>Deliberately over-the-top reputation. Lack of aging made relatively public by way of universally repeated rumor. Said (rather insultingly) to have "a penchant for suits, fine liqours and loose women". An example from a typical report:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                    <p>He has been friendly with people of many political stances and is generally well liked if not respected. When he does become angered, even heads of state are quick to appease him and commonly offer sincere apologies.</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Usually said to have a number of over-the-top traits, such as never bringing his hands more than a few inches apart, and ordinarily being slow and sluggish and then displaying amazing feats of strength.</p>

                    <p><strong>Administrator: "Frederick Williams"</strong></p>
                    <p>Male. European descent. American origin. Mid-30s. No unusual appearance.</p>

                    <p><strong>Administrator: "Agnes Peterson"</strong></p>
                    <p>Female. European descent. American origin. Verified post-human lifespan. Appears 50+. Old fashioned, wears horn-rim glasses, keeps hair in a bun. Very proper.</p>
                    <p>One of the original founders of the SCP Foundation. Pulled together the initial members into an organization; produced order from the initial chaos. Jokingly referred to as being very good at herding cats. Brisk in manner. Smart, ambitious, and good at knowing when to either create or ignore rules of order.</p>

                    <p><strong>Administrator: "Kismet"</strong></p>
                    <p>Female. Middle Eastern descent. American origin. Verified post-human lifespan. Appears 50+. No unusual appearance.</p>
                    <p>Her role is to track down and select each new and future member of O5 Command. She is a trained mathematician, and uses a form of statistics along with occultic procedures for her selection methods. She has personally selected every single member of O5 Command, in some cases years in advance. She occasionally also opts to choose their number, though which number is sometimes kept secret from all others except her and her staff until the new promotion is ready (presumably via a slot being opened).</p>

                    <p><strong>Administrator: "Spider"</strong></p>
                    <p>Masculine. Descent/origin unknown. Head appears 30+. Unkempt hair. Wears thick-lensed glasses. Wears <a href="/scp-262">SCP-262</a> (Coat of Many Arms). Nonhuman body.</p>
                    <p>Apparently a human hybrid, or nonhuman entirely. Remarkable in appearance: A mostly human head, albeit with orange eyes. Body is completely nonhuman and hardly even bipedal, made of a twisted, weathered charcoal-like material, with atrophied natural limbs. A steel mesh covering holds the body inside the Coat of Many arms, and some of the many arms keep it in place. Other arms make up his "arms" and "legs", giving him either a generally humanoid look or a rather spidery look depending on how subtle he's attempting to be.</p>
                    <p>Apparently associated with the SCP Foundation since its inception, though always in a supporting role, not at the top of the power structure. Possibly owns the land Site-19 is built on. Only a few personnel outside of O5 Command have ever seen him.</p>
                    <p>References in reports claim this Administrator originates from "The Plane Where Eyes Cannot Follow."</p>
