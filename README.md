<h1>Project Capstone</h1>
<p>Rethinking the SCP Foundation</p>
<br>
<h2>MVP Pitch</h2>
<p>This wesbite it working to help the stories and mythology behind the SCP Foundation universe become more easily accessible to individuals not familiar with the SCP Foundation's website. This is being accomplished through simplifying the UX and improving the immersiveness while retaining the functionality present in the original site. User’s should be able to view SCP Articles and Tales and search for specific pages by authorship, tag, title, or number. User’s can register and login to their account in order to save existing pages or make their own. Using their profile page users can view their profile’s information and list of saved posts and edit either when they wish to. </p>
<h2>User Stories</h2>
<ul>
<li>The website presents a loading screen before the homepage.</li>
<li> I can view SCP articles and tales which consist of a title, text, and occasionally images.</li>
<li> I can create a personal profile through which I can interact with the site.</li>
<li>I can write and post my own SCP articles.</li>
<li> I can edit my own articles but not other user's.</li>
<li> I can search for SCP articles by tag, number, title, or authorship.</li>
<li> I can click on a help button on the homepage to make explanatory text appear</li>
<li>I can save tales or SCP articles to my profile. I can see a list of my saved pages and pages I have written under my profile.</li>
<li>I can use a rich text editor to create my SCP article or Tale.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Milestones</h2>
